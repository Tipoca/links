KNOWN ISSUES

 * Browsers other than Firefox are currently unsupported (limited support for IE).

 * Client-side equality is completely broken.

 * The following web features have not yet been implemented.
   - URLs
   - Arbitrary HTTP headers, response codes
   - Accessibility standards

 * Linked stylesheets don't work (use embedded styles instead).

 * Form-handling needs to be completely redesigned.
 
 * There is no way to get the value of a radio button element.

 * It is not possible to pass XML values across the client / server boundary.

 * Passing strings from client to server sometimes breaks.

 * Returning a seq'ce of XML items at the toplevel gives "ASSERTION FAILED:
   Top-level expression was not XML"

 * A top-level variable cannot be redefined in the interactive shell:

    links> var x = 1;;
    1 : Int
    links> var x = 2;;
    Duplicate top-level bindings
    x:
      <stdin>:1
    links>
  
  * Type errors sometimes print the wrong expression, e.g.:

     links> 1 + "a"
     <string>:1: Type error: `1 + "a"', which has type (Int) -> Int, 
     cannot be applied to `"a"', of type String

 * XML support is incomplete, e.g.:
   - Ill-formed XML can sometimes be accepted
   - CDATA literals are not accepted.
   - XML namespaces are not handled.
   - Non-ASCII characters are not handled.

 * Test coverage is limited.

 * A loop variable that is used bare (without a projection) within a
   comprehension is not optimized into SQL. Example:

      for x <- (...) in
        for y <- (...) in
          [(x, y)]
